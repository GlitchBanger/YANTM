# YANTM

## About the Project

I am trying to make a game that is open source with a convoluted storyline and amazing gameplay. 
This is it's public repository, also this game will be made with 100% rust.
I will post about the story lines here in this file and I will always commit versions that compile.

## Current Storyline

This is cutscene1 where a man is walking down the road his house is in the middle and he has two neighbor. 
There is a homeless man looking through their trash. The homeless man notices that this man is bleeding from the back of his head heavily.
The homeless man is afraid and is running away. The man knocks his door. His wife opens it. She finds him dead on the ground.

```
